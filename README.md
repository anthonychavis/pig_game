## Introduction

The goal of the project was primarily to practice javascript functionality.
Additionally, I wanted to practice CSS Grid layout and utilizing CSS Variables.
From creating my own layout and selecting the colors to adding in a modal window to explain how the game is played, I actually had a lot of fun building this project!

## Technologies

-   JavaScript6
-   CSS3 - Grid, Flexbox, Variables
-   HTML5
